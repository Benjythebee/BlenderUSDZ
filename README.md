BlenderUSDZ
Simple USDZ file exporter plugin for Blender3D

Requirements
This plugin is capable of either creating USDZ files on its own or with Apple's USDZ Converter tool bundled with the latest version of Xcode.

Installation
Download io_export_usdz.zip Open Blender 2.80 and go to edit -> User Preferences... Under Add-ons press Install add-on from file and chose the zip file. Check the box next to Import-Export: USDZ Export

Usage Notes
Always be sure to save your work before attempting to export. This plugin has only been tested to work on Mac-OS only with no guarantees that Windows or Linux will even work. USDZ file creation without Apple's Converter is a new feature that has not been thoroughly tested with this plugin. If any issue should arise with compatibly or errors with the generated USDZ file it is recommended to check the Use Converter box.
