# BlenderUSDZ
Simple USDZ file exporter plugin for Blender3D

## Requirements
This plugin currently uses Apple's USDZ Converter tool.
This plugin will only work with Blender 2.79 on a Mac with XCode Command Line Tools installed.

## Notes
This plugin currently has limited functionality with more coming soon.
The plugin only exports mesh objects with Blender Internal materials.
Be sure to always save your work before each use.
